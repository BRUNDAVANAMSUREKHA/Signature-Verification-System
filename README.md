# Signature-verification-System
The Signature Verification System is a Python and Tkinter application designed for signature authentication. It compares two user input signature samples and calculates a match accuracy rate. If the accuracy is above 85%, the signature is considered valid; otherwise, it is marked as potentially fraudulent.
